## 3D Console Renderer in C#
This project is a simple 3D raycasting engine implemented in C# that runs in the console. 
It simulates a first-person perspective in a maze-like environment using ASCII characters. 
The engine is inspired by old-school raycasting techniques, similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

### features
using only c# without other libraries and packages
>3D perspective rendering in a console window
 
> Smooth movement and rotation using keyboard inputs (WASD)

> Collision detection to prevent walking through walls

> Different wall shading based on distance for depth perception

> Floor shading for a more realistic look
